== Description ==

Escoteiros do Brasil WordPress Theme is designed to take advantage of the new design tools introduced since WordPress 6.1. With a clean, blank base as a starting point, this theme includes three variations
(monosite, multisite) created by members of the Brazil Scout Volunteers Developer community.

Whether you want to build a complex or incredibly simple website, you can do it quickly and intuitively through the bundled styles or dive into creation and full customization yourself.
